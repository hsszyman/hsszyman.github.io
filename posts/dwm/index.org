  Dwm is a window manager for Linux, and while not as fully featured as something like I3, it is much more configurable. 
While most window managers rely on customization through a seperate config file dwm instead opts for users to edit its source code directly. Initially this seems like an absurd requirement to configure your system, but it's a lot more manageable when the source code is less than 2000 lines.

Today i'm going to show an example of how DWM configuration works, how to clone dwm itself, and how to write a patch.
