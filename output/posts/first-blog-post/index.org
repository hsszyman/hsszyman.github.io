Finally got my new blog set up. It uses nikola as a static site generator and an orgmode plugin to play nicely with emacs and convert .org files into html ones. 

The code that makes posting a new blogpost relatively easy is this bit of lisp code i put in my config file
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
	(setq blog-repo "~/repos/hsszyman.github.io/")
	(defun new-post (title)
	  "New Blog Post"
	  (interactive "sEnter post title: ")
	  (cd blog-repo)
	  (setq new-post-cmd (concat "nikola new_post -f orgmode -t " "\"" title "\""))
	  (shell-command new-post-cmd)
	  (setq new-post-file (concat blog-repo
				      "/posts/"
				      (replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" title)
				      ".org"))
	  (find-file new-post-file))
#+END_SRC
