  Dwm is a window manager for Linux, and while not as fully featured as something like I3, it is much more configurable. 
While most window managers rely on customization through a seperate config file dwm instead opts for users to edit its source code directly. Initially this seems like an absurd requirement to configure your system, but it's a lot more manageable when the source code is less than 2000 lines.
